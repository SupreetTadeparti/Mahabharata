Briefly, the Vina consists of a bamboo of about p. 64 cubits attached to two gourds towards its ends.

All these pass over a number of frets, two and a half heptachords, representing the total compass of the instrument. The wires rest towards their ends on two pieces of ivory called Upadhanas in Sanskrit or Swaris in Urdu.
