They get whatever objects they desire and enjoy them. 1 Thus have I, ye foremost of regenerate ones, described to you what that conduct is which appertains to the quality of goodness.

The conduct which those qualities constitute has also been properly set forth. That man who always understands these qualities, succeeds in enjoying the qualities without being attached to them.'"
