country of the Sindhu, and the kings of the southern and the western countries and of the hilly regions, and Sakuni, the ruler of the Gandharas, and all the chiefs of the eastern and the northern regions, and the Sakas, the Kiratas, and Yavanas, the Sivis and the Vasatis with their Maharathas at the heads of their respective divisions. All these great car-warriors marched in the second division. Then came Kritavarman at the head of his troops, and that mighty car-warrior, viz., the ruler of the Trigartas, and the king Duryodhana surrounded by his brothers, and Sala, and Bhurisravas, and Salya, and Vrihadratha, the ruler of the Kosalas. These all marched in the rear, with Dhritarashtra's sons at their head. And all these Dhartarashtras endued with great might, uniting together in proper order, and all clad in mail, took up their position at the other end of Kurukshetra, and, O Bharata, Duryodhana caused his encampment to be so adorned as to make it look like a second Hastinapura. Indeed, O king, even those that were clever among the citizens of Hastinapura could not distinguish their city from the encampment. And the Kuru king caused inaccessible pavilions, similar to his own, to be erected by hundreds and thousands for the (other) kings (in his army). And those tents, O king, for the accommodation of the troops were well-planted on an area measuring full five yojanas of that field of battle. And into those tents by thousands that were full of provisions, the rulers of the earth entered, each according to his courage according to the strength he possessed. And king Duryodhana ordered excellent provisions to be supplied for all those high-souled kings with their troops consisting of infantry, elephants, and horses, and with all their followers. And as regards all those that subsisted upon mechanical arts and all the bards, singers, and panegyrists devoted to his cause, and vendors and traders, and prostitutes, and spies, and persons who had come to witness the battle, the Kuru king made due provision for all of them.'"
