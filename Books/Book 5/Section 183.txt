force of this thy weapon, the son of Jamadagni, will fall asleep! Vanquishing him thus, thou wilt again awaken him in battle, O Bhishma, with that dear weapon called Samvodhana! Do what we have told thee, O Kauravya, in the morning, stationed on thy car. Asleep or dead we reckon it as the same, O king, Rama will not surely die! Apply, therefore, this Praswapa weapon so happily thought of!--Having said this, O king, those foremost of Brahmanas, eight in number and resembling one another in form, and possessed of effulgent bodies, all vanished from my sight!'"
